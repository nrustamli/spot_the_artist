Here is the executive summary and the step-by-step execution plan for **"The Anna Laurini Project."**

**🎨 Project Summary: The Anna Laurini Digital Hunt**

The Concept  
A "Pokémon GO" style web-experience for street art. Fans of the artist Anna Laurini explore cities (London, Paris, Rome) to find her iconic "Face" artworks. When they spot one, they use the app to verify the find and add it to their digital collection.  
The Client  
Anna Laurini – A prominent street artist known for her distinct, cubist-inspired faces with bold outlines and red lips. Her style is consistent, making it an ideal candidate for AI recognition.  
The Core Technology  
Instead of manual moderation, we use an AI Vision Model (CLIP).

* **How it works:** The AI compares user uploads against a "Truth Database" of Anna's known works.  
* **The Brain:** It understands concepts (like "painted face on wall"), making it robust against bad lighting, angles, or pedestrians walking by.

The MVP (Minimum Viable Product)  
A mobile-friendly website where users can:

1. Upload a photo.  
2. Get instant AI feedback ("Approved" or "Rejected").  
3. (Future) View their collection in a gallery.

**🚀 Essential Steps to Launch (The MVP)**

These steps are designed to be executed entirely in the cloud (Google Colab) so you can test the concept without buying servers.

### **Phase 1: The Setup (Data)**

* \[ \] **Gather the "Truth":** Download 15–20 clear, high-quality images of Anna Laurini’s street art.  
* \[ \] **Gather the "Noise":** Download 5 random street photos (graffiti, brick walls, cars) to test for false positives.  
* \[ \] **Organize:** Save these in a folder on your computer named reference\_art.

### **Phase 2: The Intelligence (Google Colab)**

* \[ \] **Open Notebook:** Start a new Google Colab notebook.  
* \[ \] **Enable GPU:** Go to Runtime \> Change runtime type \> Select **T4 GPU**.  
* \[ \] **Install Dependencies:** Run the installation command (pip install fastapi uvicorn...).  
* \[ \] **Upload Data:** Drag and drop your reference\_art folder into the Colab file sidebar.

### **Phase 3: The Engine (Coding the Server)**

* \[ \] **Load the Model:** Run the Python script to download the openai/clip-vit-base-patch32 model.  
* \[ \] **Cache the Features:** Run the script that pre-scans your reference images and turns them into mathematical vectors (numbers).  
* \[ \] **Create the API:** Run the FastAPI code block that creates the /verify endpoint.

### **Phase 4: The Connection (Going Live)**

* \[ \] **Get ngrok Token:** Create a free account at [ngrok.com](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://ngrok.com) and copy your Authtoken.  
* \[ \] **Bridge the Gap:** Paste the token into the Colab script and run the final cell.  
* \[ \] **Get the URL:** Copy the https://....ngrok-free.app link generated by the script.

### **Phase 5: The Test**

* \[ \] **Open the Interface:** Visit YOUR\_NGROK\_URL/docs in your phone browser.  
* \[ \] **Simulate a User:** Click POST /verify \-\> Try it out \-\> Upload a photo of Anna’s art.  
* \[ \] **Verify Logic:**  
  * If you upload Anna’s art, the score should be **\> 80%**.  
  * If you upload a cat, the score should be **\< 60%**.

**Next Step (After MVP Success)**

Once you confirm the Colab script works:

1. **Frontend:** Build a simple HTML/React page that sends photos to your API URL instead of using the /docs test screen.  
2. **Deployment:** Move the code from "temporary" Google Colab to a "permanent" cloud host (like **Google Cloud Run** or **Hugging Face Spaces**) so it stays online 24/7.
